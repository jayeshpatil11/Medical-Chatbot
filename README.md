##  Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that lets you ask medical questions grounded in a curated PDF knowledge base (e.g. an encyclopedia of medicine). Instead of hallucinating, the LLM is constrained by retrieved passages from a FAISS vector store built from your documents.
